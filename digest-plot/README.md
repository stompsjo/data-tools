# Digest Plot Generation Tool

## Overview

This tool generates plots of data over the last day, week and month, for every node. These plots are displayed in a table sorted by the ontology of the data for each node. The tables contain links to each plot that exists. Not every node has data for every ontology, so those rows are unlinked. The plots can be updated daily.  
Digest plots are generated daily for every project and can be found at www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/waggle/downloads/vis/.

## Requirements  

This tool depends on **python3**, the **numpy**, **pandas**, and **jinja2** packages for python3, as well as **gnuplot** and **curl**. Please make sure they are installed in the system where they are intended to be used.  
The bash shell scripts this tool uses require a Linux or Mac OS X environment to run.  
The project directory used as input must have the following files:
* `data.csv.gz`
* `nodes.csv`
* `sensors.csv`
* `offsets.csv`  

**Note:** this tool specifically requires `data.csv.gz`, not `data.csv`

## How to Use

To run the scripts, use the command line to navigate to the `digest-plot` directory within the repository.  

To retrieve data run `./stage_project.sh project_id`  
To generate the plots run `./create_project_graphs.sh project_directory_path`  
To generate the tables run `python3 gen_tables.py project_directory_path`

## Documentation

### Data Retrieval

`stage_project.sh project_id` downloads and untars a project based on its id.  

`project_id` is the id of the project to download. A list of datasets for different projects is available at http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/waggle/downloads/datasets/index.php.

### Data Extraction and Plot Generation

`create_project_graphs.sh project_directory_path` calls multiple other scripts in order to extract the data into plottable datasets and generate plots using those datasets.  

`project_directory_path` is the path to the directory created by `stage_project.sh`, inside the `scratch` directory, which contains `data.csv.gz`, `nodes.csv`, `sensors.csv`, `offsets.csv`, `provenance.csv`, and `README.md`.  

Given a valid project directory, the `slice-date-range` tool is used to cut `data.csv.gz` into daily slices and uncompress the resulting files. Then `extract_nodes.py` is used to get the data for each node from each day. Then `gen_digest_plots.py` extracts the rest of the data for each ontology into a plottable dataset and generates plots for all of the data that exists for each node.

The data is obtained from a complete data set at http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/waggle/downloads/datasets/index.php. The data is then split into daily chunks using the `slice-date-range` tool which can also be found in this repository. Then data for each node is extracted from the daily chunks, and finally the data for each ontology is extracted. The data is then combined into 1 day, 7 day and 30 day datasets suitable for plotting.

## Plot Generation

Plots are generated for each of the 3 time periods, day, week and month every time the script is executed. Plot generation generally consists of setting up parameters to be written to `graph.plt` to be plotted by gnuplot.  
Plots are saved to the project directory specified by `project_directory_path` in a folder called plots.

## Table Generation

Tables for each node are generated based on the ontologies present in `sensors.csv` from the requested dataset. For each ontology, if a corresponding plot exists, then a link to that plot will be in the table.  
Tables are saved to the project directory specified by `project_directory_path` in a folder called tables.
