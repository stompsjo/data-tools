CSV to HDF5 converter for AOT data
==================================

A set of scripts to convert the raw CSV data to a HDF5 file. The code is written in
Python and C, where the C based functions are used to extract the data for a single
node and write into individual subsystem files.

The subsystem files thus written by the C functions are then used by Python scripts
to write a HDF5 file. Additional code is also provided to aid in processing of the
HDF5 for data analysis. This code has primarily been developed for exploring the
data stored in the CSV files.

Motivation
----------

The raw CSV files written by AOT nodes can be quite massive. To speed up the reading
and writing of the files, a set of c functions are used, which avoid the usage of multiple
unix utilities and Python's subprocess module.

Furthermore, using a HDF5 file aids in faster searching through the massive datasets
generated by AOT nodes.


Installation
------------

Some familiarity with C language is needed. The C code used here has been tested on Linux and Mac OSx,
therefore a posix machine is required.

To compile the c functions:

```bash
cd c_reader
make
cp libreadFile.so ../
```
