# Waggle Data Manipulation Tool

All systems which build on the Waggle Platform share a common archive format for exported data.  This python tool helps manipulate the large comma-separated format (CSV) data from sensors: `data.csv`

## Design

The program takes a CSV that contains field headers and corresponding rows of data and manipulates it based on command-line options. The tool can be applied repeatedly to extract data or build larger data products.

```
 [data.csv] ---> [wg_datatool] ---> [Output File1] ---> [wg_datatool] --- [Output File2] ---> ...
```

## Commands:

Supported commands are `grep`, `cut`, and `add`.

- `grep` selects rows from the input file, such as by `timestamp` and/or `node_id`
- `cut` removes a column of data
- `add` adds a new column of data

## Usage:

*Note: the tool looks for `nodes.csv` and `sensors.csv` at the same directory that `data.csv` is located*

Synopsis:
```
$ python3 wg_datatool.py --help
usage: wg_datatool.py [-h] [-v] [-i INPUT] [-o OUTPUT] [-g GREP_OP]
                      [-c CUT_OP] [-a ADD_OP] [-j CPU] [--all_cpu]

Manipulate csv dataset

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --version
  -i INPUT, --input INPUT
                        Input file path

  -g GREP_OP, --grep GREP_OP
                        Grep operations
  -c CUT_OP, --cut CUT_OP
                        Cut operations

[ INFO  ] Took 0.00 seconds for input file indexing
[ INFO  ] Took 0.01 seconds for the manipulation
[ INFO  ] Took 0.00 seconds for merging output
[ INFO  ] Manipulation is completed.
